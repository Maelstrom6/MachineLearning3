Which	brings	me	to	2012.
It	is	important	to	remember	the	many,	many	successes	that	we	have	achieved	since	1994	-
many	of	them	as	a	result	of	government	action:
• We	have	experienced	18	years	of	economic	growth	- interrupted	only	briefly	by	the
global	economic	crisis	of	2008.
• We	have	shown	that	we	can	compete	with	the	best	in	the	world,	particularly	in	banking
and	financial	services.	And	in	sport	as	well!
• We	have	also	made	significant	social	progress:
o The	percentage	of	the	population	living	in	absolute	poverty	has	declined	from	31%
in	1995,	to	23%	in	2008	- largely	because	of	social	grants.
o 94%	of	households	now	have	access	to	drinkable	water;
o more	than	three	million	housing	units	have	been	built	- enough	to	house	- almost	a
quarter	of	the	population	- with	another	million	units	in	the	pipeline;
o three	quarters	of	the	population	now	have	access	to	electricity	and	sanitation
compared	with	only	half	in	1994;
• We	have	experienced	moments	- like	the	2010	Soccer	World	Cup	- when	we	have	lived
up	to	Archbishop	Tutu’s	characterization	of	us	as	the	Rainbow	Nation	of	God.
Nor	 would	 it	 be	 fair	 to	 blame	 all	 our	 present	 problems	 solely	 on	 the	 Government.	 	 The
reality	is	that	it	has	had	to	contend	with enormous	socio-economic	backlogs	inherited	from
the	past.
